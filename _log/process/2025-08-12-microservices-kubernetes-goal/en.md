I want to gain a deeper understanding of how microservices and Kubernetes can be applied in practice to build scalable and flexible systems. The goal is to establish a solid architecture where system components are well-defined and loosely coupled, allowing them to be developed and operated independently. At the same time, Kubernetes should support operational reliability by ensuring that the system runs in a stable, scalable, and dependable manner.
