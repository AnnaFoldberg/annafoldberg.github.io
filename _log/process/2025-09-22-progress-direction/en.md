**Feedback**  
I have gained a deeper understanding of microservices and their security aspects. To put this knowledge into practice, I built a mini application, [`TeaApp`](https://github.com/annafoldberg/tea-app), where I experimented with microservices architecture and technologies in a real setup. Through this project, I learned how to use GraphQL, RabbitMQ messaging, authentication with OAuth 2.0 and Microsoft Entra, Kong as an API gateway, and Docker for containerization.  

I chose to postpone the Kubernetes learning path to avoid gathering too much information at once. I wanted to fully understand the concepts from the microservices path before adding more complexity.  

**Feed-forward**  
My next step will be to complete the Kubernetes learning path. Once that foundation is in place, I plan to expand [`TeaApp`](https://github.com/annafoldberg/tea-app) by integrating my Kubernetes learnings, along with additional topics from the microservices learning path, such as service mesh, secrets management, and observability.  
After that, I will move on to a broader focus on IT security.
