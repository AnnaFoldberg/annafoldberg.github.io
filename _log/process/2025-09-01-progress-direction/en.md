**Feedback**  
I have set up a framework for how I approach my subjects, including where I start and how I document my work in my portfolio. I have gathered a broad base of information and gained an understanding of the overall context from a high-level perspective. With this foundation, I am now ready to dive deeper into the details.  

**Feed-forward**  
I will deepen my work by first completing the RabbitMQ course and the learning path on microservices, and then moving on to the Kubernetes learning path. Once that foundation is in place, I plan to build a small-scale application to put the architecture into practice.  
Afterwards, I will start exploring the OWASP API Security Top 10, the OWASP Kubernetes Top 10, and the cyber security roadmap. Here, I will assess what is most relevant for the project and my personal learning goals, and based on that create a plan for how to approach each of them.
