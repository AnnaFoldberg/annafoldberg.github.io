We have temporarily paused project work to allow each of us to dive deeper into our respective topics before risking moving too far into the project without a clear direction.  
In the project guidance, we were advised to create a project plan spanning two weeks to ensure we always have a clear target. The plan can be adjusted along the way if necessary.  

##### Project Plan Weeks 38â€“39
After the meeting, we prepared the following plan for weeks 38 and 39:
> Each of us will continue working individually on our chosen topics to gain a solid understanding before beginning project work. We will each define a set of features for our focus areas in the project. These do not need to follow the same template but should be outlined in the way that feels most natural to us. These features will then form the framework for the plan from week 40 onward, when we will focus on implementing them in the system.
