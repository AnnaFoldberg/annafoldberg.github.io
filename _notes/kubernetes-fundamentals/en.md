Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestrator written in Go, designed for planet-scale deployment. It decides where and how containerized applications run on servers, manages scaling up and down of replicas, and handles failures of applications or servers. 

By adjusting the number of pods and nodes based on demand, Kubernetes provides automatic elasticity.
