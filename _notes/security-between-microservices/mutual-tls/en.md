In a zero-trust model, each microservice verifies the identity of any caller and the integrity of the data it receives. Digital certificates are the standard way to establish identity, containing entity details, a public key, and information about the issuing certificate authority.

TLS secures communication by encrypting traffic between client and server, but typically only authenticates the server. The client validates the serverâ€™s certificate against trusted authorities, while the server does not verify the client.

**Mutual TLS (mTLS)** extends this by requiring both sides to present valid certificates from a trusted authority before establishing the channel. This ensures microservices can identify and trust each other before exchanging data. mTLS is widely used to secure service-to-service communication and should also protect communication between the API gateway and microservices. Without a trusted certificate, even an attacker inside the network cannot call a service.

Managing mTLS at scale introduces challenges. Microservices often run in ephemeral containers, so certificate provisioning and rotation must be automated. Container orchestrators and service meshes typically include built-in features to manage these tasks.
