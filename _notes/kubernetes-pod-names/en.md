A typical Kubernetes pod name might look like this: `myapp-7c9d7bc5b8-2xkpf`. It consists of three parts, each with a specific meaning.

1. `myapp`: The name from the Deployment object. All pods created by a deployment start with this prefix.
2. `7c9d7bc5b8`: ReplicaSet hash. This is a hash generated by Kubernetes to identify the ReplicaSet associated with the current Deployment version. Each time spec.template changes, a new ReplicaSet with a new hash is created.
3. `2xkpf`: Pod ID. This is a unique suffix added by Kubernetes to ensure no two pods ever share the same name. It identifies the individual pod.

You may therefore see pods like these, all belonging to the same Deployment and ReplicaSet, but each with its own unique Pod ID:

```yaml
myapp-7c9d7bc5b8-2xkpf
myapp-7c9d7bc5b8-hlsbr
myapp-7c9d7bc5b8-rrlqt
```
