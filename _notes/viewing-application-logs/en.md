Another way to verify that an application is working in Kubernetes is by inspecting the logs generated by its Pods. Application logs provide insight into runtime activity and are often essential for debugging.

##### Steps
1. **List Pods in a namespace:** Run `kubectl get pods -n development`. Copy the name of the Pod whose logs should be inspected.  
2. **View the logs:** Run `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n development`. This prints the log output of the selected Pod.
