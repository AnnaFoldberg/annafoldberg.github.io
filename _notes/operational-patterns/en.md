Operational patterns describe the practices that keep a microservices system observable, manageable, and reliable in production.

**Log Aggregation Pattern**

Logs are one of the most valuable sources of operational data. With microservices, logs are scattered across many services, so they must be aggregated into a single stream.

Consistency is critical: log structure, format, and taxonomy should be shared across services, even in a polyglot environment. Structured logs reduce parsing overhead, and trace identifiers must be injected in the same way everywhere to reconstruct call stacks.

**Metrics Aggregation Pattern**

Metrics provide system-level insights with less overhead than logs. Standard libraries and shipping formats make metrics collection widely available across languages.

Effective monitoring depends on taxonomy and visualization. Dashboards should be built at both high and detailed levels, enriched with events such as deployments and alarms tied to runbooks. Metrics aggregation allows system health to be assessed without reading raw logs.

**Tracing Pattern**

Tracing recreates the call stack across service boundaries. A trace identifier is injected at the system edge and propagated through all calls, ideally down to the database.

This identifier should be included in every log message, enabling correlation of logs and traces. Standards-based tracing, combined with visualization tools, makes distributed call flows diagnosable in a way monolithic logs cannot.

**External Configuration**

Externalizing configuration improves flexibility and troubleshooting. Config values should be injected or retrieved rather than embedded in code, with consistent tooling and naming conventions.

It is better to externalize too much than too little, as missing configuration can hinder operations. At the same time, secrets must be protected carefully.

**Service Discovery**

As the number of services grows, static configuration becomes unmanageable. Service discovery provides a central registry where services advertise their endpoints and capabilities.

Other services can query the registry to resolve URIs dynamically, avoiding hard-coded addresses. This supports scaling to hundreds or thousands of services without manual configuration.

**Continuous Delivery**

Continuous delivery ensures that code moves to production through fully automated pipelines. This includes artifact publishing, integration testing, deployment, and security testing.

Once in production, automation continues through scheduled smoke tests. In microservices, CI/CD is essential, as manual deployments cannot scale with the number of services.

**Documentation**

Clear and consistent documentation is critical in microservices. OpenAPI is widely used for RESTful contracts, supporting both contract-first and code-first development.

Documentation should be exposed in a central location, with examples of API usage included. A consistent documentation repository helps teams navigate a complex system.
