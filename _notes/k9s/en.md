k9s makes it easier to navigate, observe, and manage Kubernetes clusters through a terminal-based UI. It provides a unified overview of pods, deployments, Helm releases, services, namespaces, and network policies, and makes it simple to inspect resources, follow real-time logs, and restart or delete resources.
