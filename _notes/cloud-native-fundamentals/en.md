Cloud native technologies are open-source tools that enable organizations to build and run scalable applications across dynamic environments, such as public, private, or hybrid clouds, by using containers, microservices, service meshes, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs to automatically deploy and scale applications.

##### Principles
Cloud native assumes that silos between system administrators, infrastructure engineers, and software engineers should be removed. Code changes can then be quickly and automatically tested and pushed to production, rather than waiting for weekly, monthly, or quarterly release dates.

##### CNCF Designations
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) tracks the maturity of cloud-native projects:  
- **Graduated projects:** Ready for use in production environments.
- **Incubating projects:** Used in production by a limited number of companies.
- **Sandbox projects:** New experimental projects still under development.

Kubernetes was the CNCFâ€™s first graduated project.

##### Other CNCF Open-Source Projects
- Helm  
- Prometheus  
- Linkerd
