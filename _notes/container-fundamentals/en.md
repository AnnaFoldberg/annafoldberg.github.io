Containers are a technology that bundle application code together with its runtime configuration into a single unit.

##### Advantages
- **Portable:** Run on Linux, Windows, or macOS.
- **Efficient:** Use fewer CPUs and memory, reducing costs.
- **Self-contained:** Start or stop in seconds.
- **Scalable:** Easily replicate and scale up or down elastically.

##### Key Terms
- **Image:** A file containing executable code, which can be run as a container.
- **Container Registry:** A database for storing container images, either public or private. Examples include Docker Hub, Quay, and Google Container Registry.
