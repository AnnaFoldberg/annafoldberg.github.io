Our current focus as a project group is to clarify the fundamental structure of the project, including which system development method to follow and which artifacts to produce.

**System Development Method**  
We are currently leaning towards a feature-driven approach, with an emphasis on delivering a minimum viable product. To guide our prioritization, we will apply the MoSCoW method to determine the relative importance of each feature from the perspective of the product owner.  

**Artifacts**  
The core artifacts we have identified as the minimum required documentation for each feature are:  
- Casual use cases  
- System sequence diagram  
- Domain model  
- Domain class diagram  
- Sequence diagram  
- ER diagram
